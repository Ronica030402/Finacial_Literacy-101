    <ul>
        <li><b>Self-Directed Investing:</b><br>The answer to the question "how to invest" depends on whether you are a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) type of investor or would rather have a professional manage your money.

            DIY investing, also known as self-directed investment, calls for a good deal of knowledge, expertise, time commitment, and emotional restraint.

With technological developments, roboadvisors can now do more than just choose assets. They can aid in the creation of retirement plans as well as the administration of trusts and other retirement accounts like 401(k)s.</li>
