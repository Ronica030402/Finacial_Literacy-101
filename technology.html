    <h2>Introduction to how technology can help sustain small businesses </h2>
    <h4>How is IoT Relevant for Small Businesses?</h4>
    <p>Firstly let's start by explaning what is IoT(Internet of Things)</p><br>
    <p>The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of connected computing devices, mechanical and digital<br>
         machines, objects, animals, or people that can exchange data over a network without requiring hum<br>
         -an-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.</p>
</div>
<P>IoT devices easily remove process restrictions and solve conventional business challenges. As a result,<br>
     firms are able to optimize everything, experience more production, cut costs, and do a lot more.<br>
     Consider these 4 typical business needs that IoT provides excellent support for.</P>
     <ol>
        <li>Access Control</li>
        <p>Internet-enabled smart locks can be useful for manufacturing and retail businesses. These<br>
             are the ideal instances of how IoT effortlessly resolves complex company issues.<br>
             Businesses may regulate access to physical places without the usual limitations thanks <br>
             to smart locks. Smart locks enable anything with just a few clicks, including changing <br>
             passwords from a distance, tracking all accesses, and easily canceling access.</p>
             <li>Monitoring/Event Recording</li>
             <p>Smart cameras are an excellent example of how IoT devices can help small businesses.<br>
                These Internet-connected video cameras may capture footage in high definition and <br>
                upload it to the cloud. As a result, companies are spared the expense of purchasing <br>
                closed-circuit cameras, which can cost between R1,000 and R4,000 each. Any company <br>
                that needs to record extensive amounts of video cannot ignore the cost savings.</p>
                <li>Dynamic Inventory Management</li>
         <p>The usefulness of smart RFID tags for companies that deal in fast-moving consumer<br>
                     goods (FMCGs) is enormous. These little gadgets show how IoT can give businesses <br>
                     productivity advantages that have never been seen before.You can affix these <br>
                     reasonably priced RFID tags on goods. Then, portable devices can document <br>
                     activities like sales, returns, quarantine for quality assurance, etc. This<br>
                      significantly accelerates retail operations.</p>
                      <li>Equipment Maintenance</li>
                      <p>For many small firms, downtime is the scourge of their lives. Equipment failures <br>
                        typically take many hours to recover from, and they cost businesses on average <br>
                        R10,000 per hour.Imagine being able to do upkeep and repairs before any downtime <br>
                        occurs! That sounds magical, doesn't it? IoT sensors have that kind of power.<br>
                        IoT sensors can alert small businesses to an approaching breakdown so they can<br>
                         appoint a technician in advance to minimize downtime when they are configured <br>
                         appropriately. This is preferable to trying to control everything after a collapse <br>
                         has already happened.</p>
     </ol>
